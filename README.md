CycloneDX Ruby Gem
=========

The CycloneDX Ruby Gem creates a valid CycloneDX bill-of-material document from all project dependencies. CycloneDX is a lightweight BoM specification that is easily created, human readable, and simple to parse. The resulting bom.xml can be used
with tools such as [OWASP Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) for the continuous analysis of components.
